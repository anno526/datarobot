\title{Retrieve all reason codes rows and return them as a data frame (deprecated)}
\usage{
GetAllReasonCodesRowsAsDataFrame(project, reasonCodeId,
  excludeAdjustedPredictions = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{project}{character. Either (1) a character string giving the unique alphanumeric
identifier for the project, or (2) a list containing the element projectId with this
identifier.}

\item{reasonCodeId}{character. id of the reason codes.}

\item{excludeAdjustedPredictions}{logical. Optional. Set to FALSE to include adjusted
predictions, which are predictions adjusted by an exposure column. This is only relevant for
projects that use an exposure column.}
}
\value{
data frame with following colums:
\itemize{
  \item rowId. Integer row id from prediction dataset.
  \item prediction. Numeric the output of the model for this row (numric prediction for
    regression problem, predicted class for classification problem).
  \item class1Label. Character string Label of class 0. Available only for classification
    problem.
  \item class1Probability. Numeric Predicted probability of class 0. Available only for
    classification problem.
  \item class2Label. Character string Label of class 1. Available only for classification
  \item class2Probability. Numeric Predicted probability of class 1. Available only for
    classification problem.
  \item reason1FeatureName. Character string the name of the feature contributing to the
    prediction.
  \item reason1FeatureValue. the value the feature took on for this row.
  \item reason1QualitativeStrength. Numeric how strongly the feature affected the prediction.
  \item reason1Strength. Character string  a human-readable description of how strongly the
    feature affected the prediction (e.g. '+++', '--', '+').
  \item reason1Label. Character string describes what output was driven by this reason code.
  For regression projects, it is the name of the target feature.  For classification projects,
  it is theclass whose probability increasing would correspond to a positive strength of this.
  \item reasonNFeatureName. Character string the name of the feature contributing to the
    prediction.
  \item reasonNFeatureValue. the value the feature took on for this row.
  \item reasonNQualitativeStrength. Numeric how strongly the feature affected the prediction.
  \item reasonNStrength. Character string  a human-readable description of how strongly the
    feature affected the prediction (e.g. '+++', '--', '+').
  \item reasonNLabel. Character string describes what output was driven by this reason code.
  For regression projects, it is the name of the target feature.  For classification projects,
  it is theclass whose probability increasing would correspond to a positive strength of this.
  \item reasonNFeatureName. Character string the name of the feature contributing to the
    prediction.
